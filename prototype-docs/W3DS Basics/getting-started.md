# W3DS Basics

This document provides a deep dive into the core concepts of W3DS (Web 3 Data Spaces), including [eVault](/docs/W3DS%20Basics/glossary#evault) ownership, data synchronization, and the webhook notification system. See the [Glossary](/docs/W3DS%20Basics/glossary) for other terms.

## eVault Ownership Model

In W3DS, **every user, group, and object owns their own eVault**. This is the fundamental principle that enables data portability and platform independence.

### What is an eVault?

An **eVault** is a personal data store identified by a [W3ID](/docs/W3DS%20Basics/W3ID) (also called an **eName**). It's where all data about a person, group, or object is stored in a standardized format called [MetaEnvelopes](/docs/Infrastructure/eVault#data-model).

### Ownership Structure

- **Users**: Each user has their own eVault (e.g., `@user-a.w3id`)
- **Groups**: Each group has its own eVault (e.g., `@group-1.w3id`)
- **Objects**: Important objects can have their own eVaults

### Key Characteristics

1. **Persistent Identity**: The W3ID (eName) never changes, even if the eVault URL changes
2. **User Control**: Users control access to their eVault via ACLs (Access Control Lists). Note: While the ACL system exists, there is currently no platform that allows users to change ACLs for their data - this functionality is planned for future releases.
3. **Platform Agnostic**: Platforms don't own the data - they only display it
4. **Decentralized**: Each eVault can be hosted independently

## Data Flow: Platform → eVault → All Platforms

The W3DS data flow ensures that data created on one platform automatically appears on all other platforms. Here's how it works:

### Step-by-Step Flow

Let's trace what happens when **User A creates a post on Blabsy**:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant UserA as User A
    participant Blabsy as Blabsy Platform
    participant BlabsyDB as Blabsy Database
    participant Web3Adapter as Web3 Adapter
    participant EVault as User A's eVault
    participant Pictique as Pictique Platform
    participant OtherPlatform as Other Platforms

    UserA->>Blabsy: Creates post "Hello, world!"
    Blabsy->>BlabsyDB: Store post locally
    BlabsyDB->>Web3Adapter: Entity change detected
    Web3Adapter->>Web3Adapter: Convert to global schema
    Web3Adapter->>EVault: storeMetaEnvelope(post data)
    EVault->>EVault: Store as MetaEnvelope
    Note over EVault: Wait 3 seconds<br/>(prevent ping-pong)
    EVault->>Pictique: POST /api/webhook (post data)
    EVault->>OtherPlatform: POST /api/webhook (post data)
    Pictique->>Pictique: Convert to local schema
    Pictique->>Pictique: Create post in local DB
    OtherPlatform->>OtherPlatform: Convert to local schema
    OtherPlatform->>OtherPlatform: Create post in local DB
    Note over UserA,Pictique: User A now has the post<br/>on Pictique without visiting it!
```

### Detailed Breakdown

#### 1. User Creates Post on Blabsy

User A opens Blabsy and creates a post with the text "Hello, world!". Blabsy stores this in its local PostgreSQL database.

#### 2. Web3 Adapter Detects Change

The platform needs to detect when data changes in its local database. This can be implemented using:

- **Database triggers**: Set up triggers that fire on INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE operations
- **ORM event listeners**: If using an ORM, hook into entity lifecycle events (afterInsert, afterUpdate, etc.)
- **Change data capture (CDC)**: Monitor database transaction logs
- **Application-level hooks**: Call the adapter directly after database operations

The adapter must receive:
- The changed entity data (as a dictionary/object)
- The table name or entity type
- Optionally, a list of participant eNames if the entity involves multiple users

When a post is created, the platform should extract all relevant fields from the database record and pass them to the adapter's change handler along with the table name "posts".

#### 3. Convert to Global Schema

The Web3 Adapter converts the local post data to the global ontology schema. For example:

- Local: `{ text: "Hello, world!", images: [...] }`
- Global: `{ content: "Hello, world!", mediaUrls: [...] }`

This conversion uses mapping rules defined in `mapping.json` files.

#### 4. Sync to User's eVault

The adapter makes an HTTP POST request to the eVault's GraphQL endpoint. The request must include:

**HTTP Request Details**:
- **Method**: POST
- **URL**: `{evaultUrl}/graphql` (where evaultUrl is resolved from the user's [eName](/docs/W3DS%20Basics/W3ID) via [Registry](/docs/Infrastructure/Registry))
- **Headers**: 
  - `Content-Type: application/json`
  - `X-ENAME: @user-a.w3id` (the owner's eName)
- **Body**: GraphQL mutation

**GraphQL Mutation**:
```graphql
mutation CreateMetaEnvelope($input: MetaEnvelopeInput!) {
  createMetaEnvelope(input: $input) {
    metaEnvelope {
      id
      ontology
      parsed
    }
    errors {
      message
      code
    }
  }
}
```

**Variables**:
```json
{
  "input": {
    "ontology": "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440001",
    "payload": {
      "content": "Hello, world!",
      "mediaUrls": [],
      "authorId": "...",
      "createdAt": "2025-01-24T10:00:00Z"
    },
    "acl": ["*"]
  }
}
```

**Response**: The eVault returns a payload containing the created MetaEnvelope with a global ID (or errors if the operation failed). The ID should be stored for future reference.

**Implementation Notes**:
- Use any HTTP client library in your language (requests in Python, http in Go, fetch in JavaScript, etc.)
- The GraphQL request is a standard HTTP POST with JSON body
- The X-ENAME header identifies which eVault to write to
- Handle network errors and retry logic as needed

#### 5. eVault Stores MetaEnvelope

The [eVault](/docs/Infrastructure/eVault) stores the data as a [MetaEnvelope](/docs/Infrastructure/eVault#data-model), which is a flat graph structure of Envelopes. Each field becomes a separate Envelope node in Neo4j.

#### 6. Webhook Delivery (After 3 Second Delay)

After a 3-second delay (to prevent webhook ping-pong), the [eVault](/docs/Infrastructure/eVault) sends webhooks to all registered platforms (see [Registry](/docs/Infrastructure/Registry)) **except** the one that made the request (Blabsy).

The webhook payload contains:
```json
{
    "id": "global-id-123",
    "w3id": "@user-a.w3id",
    "schemaId": "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440001",
    "data": {
        "content": "Hello, world!",
        "mediaUrls": [],
        "authorId": "...",
        "createdAt": "2025-01-24T10:00:00Z"
    }
}
```

#### 7. Platforms Receive Webhooks

Pictique and other platforms receive the webhook at their `/api/webhook` endpoint. The platform must implement an HTTP POST handler that:

1. **Parse the webhook payload**: Extract `id`, `w3id`, `schemaId`, and `data` from the JSON request body

2. **Find the mapping**: Look up the mapping configuration using the `schemaId`. The mapping defines how to convert between global ontology fields and local database fields.

3. **Convert from global to local schema**: Transform the data using the mapping rules:
   - Map field names (e.g., `content` → `text`, `mediaUrls` → `images`)
   - Handle nested references (e.g., `authorId` might need to resolve to a local user ID)
   - Convert data types if needed
   - Handle array transformations

4. **Check if entity exists**: Query the ID mapping table/database to see if a local entity already exists for this global ID. The mapping stores pairs of `(globalId, localId)`.

5. **Create or update entity**:
   - If mapping exists: Update the existing local entity with the new data
   - If no mapping: Create a new entity in the local database and store the mapping

6. **Store the ID mapping**: Save the relationship between the global ID and the newly created/updated local entity ID for future lookups.

7. **Return success**: Send HTTP 200 OK response to acknowledge receipt of the webhook.

**Implementation Requirements**:
- HTTP server with POST endpoint handler
- JSON parsing library
- Database access (SQL or NoSQL)
- ID mapping storage (database table, key-value store, or in-memory cache with persistence)
- Field mapping logic (can be implemented as a simple dictionary/object transformation)

#### 8. Result

User A now has the post on Pictique (and all other platforms) without ever visiting them!

## Webhook Notification System

The webhook system is how eVaults notify platforms of data changes.

### Webhook Delivery Process

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    Start([Data Stored in eVault]) --> Delay[Wait 3 seconds]
    Delay --> GetPlatforms[Get Active Platforms from Registry]
    GetPlatforms --> Filter[Filter out Requesting Platform]
    Filter --> SendWebhooks[Send POST to /api/webhook]
    SendWebhooks --> Success{Success?}
    Success -->|Yes| LogSuccess[Log Success]
    Success -->|No| LogError[Log Error Continue]
    LogSuccess --> End([Complete])
    LogError --> End
```

### Webhook Payload Structure

Every webhook contains:

- **id**: The global ID of the MetaEnvelope
- **w3id**: The eName (W3ID) of the owner
- **schemaId**: The ontology schema ID (W3ID)
- **data**: The actual data in global ontology format
- **evaultPublicKey**: The eVault's public key (for verification)

### Platform Webhook Handling

Platforms must implement a webhook endpoint that:

1. Receives the webhook payload
2. Finds the mapping using `schemaId`
3. Converts global data to local schema using `fromGlobal()`
4. Checks if entity exists using global ID mapping
5. Creates or updates the entity
6. Stores the ID mapping

See the [Webhook Controller Guide](/docs/Post%20Platform%20Guide/webhook-controller) for implementation details.

## MetaEnvelopes and Ontology Schemas

### MetaEnvelopes

A **MetaEnvelope** is the storage format in eVaults. It's a flat graph structure where:

- Each MetaEnvelope represents one entity (post, user, message, etc.)
- Each field becomes a separate Envelope node
- Envelopes are linked to the MetaEnvelope via `LINKS_TO` relationships

### Ontology Schemas

[Ontology schemas](/docs/Infrastructure/Ontology) define the global data format. They're JSON Schema files that specify:

- Field names and types
- Required fields
- Validation rules
- Schema IDs (W3IDs) — see [Ontology](/docs/Infrastructure/Ontology) for the schema registry

Example: `SocialMediaPost` schema defines fields like `content`, `mediaUrls`, `authorId`, etc.

All platforms must map their local schemas to these global schemas. See [Mapping Rules](/docs/Post%20Platform%20Guide/mapping-rules) for details.

## W3ID (eName) System

[W3ID](/docs/W3DS%20Basics/W3ID) (also called **eName**) is the persistent identifier for users, groups, and objects.

### Format

- Global IDs: `@<W3ID>` (e.g., `@e4d909c2-5d2f-4a7d-9473-b34b6c0f1a5a`)
- Local IDs: `@<W3ID>/<W3ID>` (for objects within an eVault)

### Resolution

W3IDs are resolved to eVault URLs via the [Registry Service](/docs/Infrastructure/Registry):

```
GET /resolve?w3id=@user-a.w3id
→ Returns: https://evault.example.com/users/user-a
```

### Key Properties

1. **Persistent**: Never changes, even if eVault URL changes
2. **Globally Unique**: W3ID-based ensures uniqueness
3. **Loosely Bound to Keys**: Can rotate keys without changing W3ID
4. **Resolvable**: Registry maps W3ID to current eVault URL

## Data Ownership and ACLs

### Access Control Lists (ACLs)

[ACLs](/docs/Infrastructure/eVault#access-control) determine who can access data in an eVault. Common patterns:

- `["*"]`: Public access (anyone can read)
- `["@user-a.w3id"]`: Only User A can access
- `["@user-a.w3id", "@user-b.w3id"]`: User A and User B can access

### Ownership Model

- **Data Creator**: The user who creates data owns it
- **eVault Owner**: The user whose eVault stores the data
- **Platform Access**: Platforms can read/write based on ACLs

## Platform Independence

One of the key benefits of W3DS is **platform independence**:

1. **No Vendor Lock-in**: Users can switch platforms without losing data
2. **Multi-Platform Presence**: Data automatically appears on all platforms
3. **Platform Competition**: Platforms compete on features, not data ownership
4. **User Choice**: Users choose platforms based on UX, not data availability

## Example: Complete Post Flow

Here's a complete example showing all components working together:

```mermaid
graph LR
    subgraph UserA["User A"]
        A1[Creates Post]
    end

    subgraph Blabsy["Blabsy Platform"]
        B1[Local DB]
        B2[Web3 Adapter]
    end

    subgraph EVault["User A's eVault"]
        E1[Store MetaEnvelope]
        E2[Webhook System]
    end

    subgraph Pictique["Pictique Platform"]
        P1[Webhook Handler]
        P2[Local DB]
    end
